# 🌬️ Wind Turbine Failure Analysis using Data Analytics

![Power BI Dashboard](https://github.com/logeshkamalakannan/Analysis-of-Wind-Turbine-Failure/blob/main/windturbine(f).pbix)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing wind turbine sensor data to uncover patterns and insights that help predict and minimize unplanned failures. It aims to support preventive maintenance by leveraging data analytics and visualization tools.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation & data visualization  
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, transformation, and querying  
- **Excel** – Initial preprocessing and feature analysis  
- **Python (Optional)** – For data preprocessing and EDA

---

## 📊 Key Features
- Sensor-wise comparison of temperature readings (Failure vs No Failure)
- Average and sum analysis of temperature, speed, and yaw angle
- Identification of critical sensor behavior leading to failure
- Interactive dashboards for failure patterns
- KPI indicators for actionable business insights

---

## 📈 Insights Gained
- Certain temperature sensors show abnormal patterns before failure
- Wind misalignment and yaw angle influence operational efficiency
- Consistent patterns in bearing and generator temperature during faults

---

## 🔍 Skills Applied
- Data Mining
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dashboard Design in Power BI
- Data Cleaning and Transformation (SQL + Excel)
- Business Insight Generation
